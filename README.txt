# Azure OpenAI Integration Script

This project demonstrates how to integrate Azure OpenAI services into a Python application, leveraging the Azure OpenAI API to build an intelligent conversational assistant. The assistant, named "Forest," is designed to provide personalized hiking recommendations. By default, the assistant focuses on areas near Rainier National Park but can adapt to user-specified locations. The script uses environment variables for configuration, including the Azure API endpoint, API key, and deployment details. It employs the `python-dotenv` library for secure environment variable management and the `openai` library for API interactions. Users can interact with the assistant through the command line by providing prompts, and the assistant responds with three hiking suggestions of varying lengths, along with an interesting fact about local nature. The code includes error handling for common issues such as missing environment variables or invalid input. To use this project, configure the `.env` file with your Azure OpenAI details, install the required dependencies, and run the script. This project is ideal for developers exploring conversational AI or integrating Azure OpenAI into their applications.
