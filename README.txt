This repository contains a Python-based application that integrates with Azure Cognitive Services' Question Answering API to provide an interactive command-line interface for querying a trained FAQ knowledge base. The script, `azure7.py`, allows users to input questions and receive answers with confidence scores, leveraging Azure's `azure.ai.language.questionanswering` SDK. To use this application, you need an Azure Language Studio QnA project, Python installed on your machine, and a `.env` file configured with your Azure endpoint, API key, project name, and deployment name. After cloning the repository and installing dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you can run the script using `python azure7.py` and start submitting questions. This application is a straightforward example of how to integrate Azure's AI capabilities into a Python project, making it easy to build intelligent QnA systems.
